Documentation
--------------------------------------------

The documentation is created using `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and `read-the-docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_, which uses the reStructuredText format to create documents. To add documentation, go to the ``docs`` folder, where you will find a list of ``.rst`` files, the home page is written in ``index.rst``, and links to the other subpages which are in the other ``.rst`` files.

These documents can be opened in any text editor of your choice, to learn more about hwo to write in reStructuredText, you can read:

* https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
