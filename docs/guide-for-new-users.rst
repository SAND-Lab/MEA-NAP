Guide for New Users 
=====================

If you have **limited or no experience with MATLAB**, we recommend using our interactive GUI mode. 
This mode simplifies the process of selecting directory paths and adjusting parameters for the pipeline. 

If you are happy to use the pre-set parameters, you can use the GUI (guided user interface) by pressing run in ``MEApipeline.m``.  The GUI will guide you through selecting the folder locations of the MEA-NAP folder, your MEA data, your batch analysis file (.csv or .xlsx), and indicating what type of MEA data (i.e., 
Multichannel Systems 60 electrode or Axion Biosystems 64 electrode) you acquired.  Once complete, you can run the pipeline and it does the analysis and produces the figures and tables on its own.
