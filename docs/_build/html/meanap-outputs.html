<p>This folder contains the MATLAB file for each MEA recording with the spike times detected by each spike detection method and parameter selected.  This folder can be used by MEA-NAP to perform Steps 1B – Step 5 without repeating the spike detection.</p>
<p>Each matlab file contains the following variables:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Channels: a vector containing the numeric identified for each channel</p></li>
<li><p>spikeDetectionResult: a structure containing the parameters used for spike detection (e.g., sampling rate)</p></li>
<li><p>spikeTimes : a cell with an entry per channel, each cell entry contains a structure where the field names are the spike detection method and the field entries are the spike times in seconds</p></li>
<li><p>spikeWaveforms: same format as spikeTimes, but where each field entry are the spike waveforms detected</p></li>
<li><p>Thresholds: same format as spikeTimes, but where each field entry are the absolute values of the threshold used for spike detection (in mV), they are NaN values for wavelet detection methods as they do not rely on a threshold</p></li>

<span id="id3"></span><h2>Step 1B – Spike Detection Checks<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1b-spike-detection-checks" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This folder contains subfolders for each Group.  Each subfolder contains folders for each MEA recording by filename.</p>
<section id="subfolder-by-filename">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>Subfolder – By Filename<a class="headerlink" href="#subfolder-by-filename" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Figure 1. Example Traces.</strong> Sample 60-millisecond-long filtered voltage traces from 9 electrodes (if the default number of electrodes to plot is selected in MEA-NAP) centered on at least one action potential. The MEA recording filename is at the top of the figure.  The electrode number and time in the recording are shown above each voltage trace.  The colored arrows indicate where one or more spike detection methods and parameters identified an action potential.  Legend, bior1.3, bior1.5, and db2 are MATLAB wavelets used for template-based spike detection with the continuous wavelet transform. The median absolute deviation used for the threshold method is indicated with the prefix “thr.”  This figure facilitates comparing the performance of the spike detection methods and parameters at the individual electrode level.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2. Spike Frequencies.</strong> Line graphs show the running spike frequency (binned by 1 second) detected by each spike detection method (line color) during the length of recording in minutes. Legend, bior1.3, bior1.5, and db2 are MATLAB wavelets used for template-based spike detection with the continuous wavelet transform. The median absolute deviation used for the threshold method is indicated with the prefix “thr.”  This figure facilitates comparing the performance of the spike detection methods and parameters at the electrode level. The figure title (top) indicates the MEA recording filename. This figure facilitates comparing the performance of the spike detection methods and parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3. Waveforms.</strong> Sample of 50 action potential action potential waveforms (gray) overlayed and mean waveform (black line) detected with each spike detection method (panel title) from a sample electrode (indicated above the panels). The figure title is the MEA recording filename. For some electrodes, if fewer than 50 action potentials were detected with a specific spike detection method/parameter, then all of the action potential waveforms will be overlayed.  This figure facilitates comparing the performance of the spike detection methods and parameters.</p>

<span id="id5"></span><h2>Step 2 – Neuronal Activity<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-neuronal-activity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This folder contains two subfolders, one to evaluate the individual recordings and one with comparisons by age and group.  The Step 2A folder contains subfolders for each group and, within each group folder, individual subfolders for each recording.  The Step 2B folder contains 4 subfolders that compare metrics by node (electrode) and recording for age and group.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Firing Rate By Electrode.</strong> Scatter plot (gray circles), mean ± s.e.m. (black circle with error bars) and density curve show the mean firing rate (MFR) for each electrode in the microelectrode array (MEA) recording in spikes per second (Hz). The MFR was calculated by dividing the number of action potentials detected by the length of the recording in seconds. Figure title (top) is the name of the recording.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2. Heatmap.</strong>  Mean firing rate (MFR) by electrode (circles) in the spatial arrangement of the microelectrode array (MEA) in hertz (Hz, color bar) scaled to the recording (left) and to the entire dataset (right).  In the left panel, differences in MFR can be observed between electrodes.  In the right panel, the MFR can be seen in comparison to the whole dataset.

<p><strong>Figure 1. Significance Table by Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (STTC) Lag.</strong> Bubble plot show p-values (size of circle) for a linear mixed effect model (LME) with the group as the main effect and a random effect of the specific culture identity on the intercept (row 1) and a LME with the age as the main effect and a random effect of the specific culture identity on the intercept (row 2) for the network-level metrics (x-axis).  The rows below show the p-values for one (1)-way ANOVA tests and paired t-test with the group name and/or age in the row title.  The size of each circle is proportional to the p-value (see legend) with larger circles indicating smaller p-values.  For the LME and ANOVA tests, black indicates a p-value less than 0.05. However, it is up to the investigator to determine the relevant p-value for significance based on multiple comparisons.  For the paired t-tests, p-values less than 0.05 are colored based on the difference between the means with red indicating an increase in the mean and blue indicating a decrease in the mean (color bar, right bottom).</p>
