.. _Step 1A - Spike Detection Files:

Step 1A - Spike Detection Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This folder contains the MATLAB file for each MEA recording with the spike times detected by each spike detection method and parameter selected.  This folder can be used by MEA-NAP to perform Steps 1B – Step 5 without repeating the spike detection.

Each matlab file contains the following variables: 

- **Channels:** a vector containing the numeric identified for each channel
- **spikeDetectionResult:** a structure containing the parameters used for spike detection (e.g., sampling rate)
- **spikeTimes:** a cell with an entry per channel, each cell entry contains a structure where the field names are the spike detection method and the field entries are the spike times in seconds 
- **spikeWaveforms:** same format as spikeTimes, but where each field entry are the spike waveforms detected
- **Thresholds:** same format as spikeTimes, but where each field entry are the absolute values of the threshold used for spike detection (in mV), they are NaN values for wavelet detection methods as they do not rely on a threshold

**Figure 1. Example Traces.** Sample 60-millisecond-long filtered voltage traces from 9 electrodes (if the default number of electrodes to plot is selected in MEA-NAP) centered on at least one action potential. The MEA recording filename is at the top of the figure.  The electrode number and time in the recording are shown above each voltage trace.  The colored arrows indicate where one or more spike detection methods and parameters identified an action potential.  Legend, bior1.3, bior1.5, and db2 are MATLAB wavelets used for template-based spike detection with the continuous wavelet transform. The median absolute deviation used for the threshold method is indicated with the prefix “thr.”  This figure facilitates comparing the performance of the spike detection methods and parameters at the individual electrode level.
