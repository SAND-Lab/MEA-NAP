function ISInTh = getISInTh(SpikeTimes, N, Steps, plotFig)
%GETISINTH Returns the threshold to use for BurstDetectISIn.m 
%   Tim Sit 2018 
%   Based on HistogramISIn.m by Douglas Bakkum, 2013, but automatically
%   returns the result rather than having to eyeball it, and uses a freely
%   available (and perhaps marginally better) smoothing function 

% This is from Bakkum 2013:
% GHistogramISIn(SpikeTimes, N, Steps) 
%   'SpikeTimes' [sec] % Vector of spike times 
%   'N'                % Vector of values for plotting ISI_N histograms 
                       % can also be a single real integer value.
                       % Author recommends 10
%   'Steps' [sec]      % Vector of histogram edges 
%   'Plot'             % 1: make a plot, 0: don't plot (default)
% Steps should be of uniform width on a log scale. Note that histograms are
% smoothed using smooth.m with the default span and lowess method 
%
%
% Example code: 
%   Spike Times = -----; % load spike times here 
%   N           = [2:10]; % Range of N for ISI_N histograms 
%   Steps       = 10.^[-5:0.05:1.5] % Create uniform steps for log plot 
                % Sit 2018: I have made this optional, if no input, it will
                % automatically determine the steps, using
                % min(log(spikeTimes)):0.1:max(log(spikeTimes))
%   getISInTh(SpikeTimes, N, Steps) % Run function

    % to be some conversion of ms to s, but the input should be sec...

    n = fLOESS(n, 8/round(length(n))); % used by Sit 2018
    % the fraction of data used is not specified in the paper 
    % so I will just make a guess (using the minimum value allowed).

% Things to do to make this code to work 

% find peak,
% if no peak: return default ISIn threshold value 
% if two peaks: return valley value (ie. the minimum value between the two
% peaks) 
% if >2 peaks: use the first minima between the first pair of peaks.
