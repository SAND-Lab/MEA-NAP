% FUNCTION:
%         Returns values of AVERAGE CONTROLLABILITY for each node in a
%         network, given the adjacency matrix for that network. Average
%         controllability measures the ease by which input at that node can
%         steer the system into many easily-reachable states.
%
% INPUT:
%         A is the structural (NOT FUNCTIONAL) network adjacency matrix, 
% 	      such that the simple linear model of dynamics outlined in the 
%	      reference is an accurate estimate of brain state fluctuations. 
%	      Assumes all values in the matrix are positive, and that the 
%	      matrix is symmetric.
%
% OUTPUT:
%         Vector of average controllability values for each node
