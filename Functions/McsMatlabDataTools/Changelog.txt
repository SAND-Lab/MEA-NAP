McsMatlabDataTools
==================
--------------------------
Version 1.2.0 (2018-02-26)
--------------------------

- New feature: Plot function for McsCmosStaExplorer
- New feature: Plot function for McsCmosSpikeSorter
- Update: Added new plot options for McsSegmentStream
- Bug fix: Fixed orientation of conversion factor matrix in .cmcr files
- Bug fix: Improved compatibility with Matlab R2011a

--------------------------
Version 1.1.0 (2017-12-08)
--------------------------

- Added support for HDF5 files generated by CMOS-MEA-Control and CMOS-MEA-Tools 2.0 and newer

--------------------------
Version 1.0.4 (2017-04-05)
--------------------------

- Bug fix:
        * Compensates for the bug in DataManager version 1.9.2 and earlier 
          that lead to incorrect orientation of the conversion factor matrix for frame data.

--------------------------
Version 1.0.3 (2017-01-27)
--------------------------

- Bug fixes:
        * Rows and columns of ConversionFactors in FrameDataEntities were switched
        * Handled DataSubType Sweep in SegmentStreams

--------------------------
Version 1.0.2 (2016-06-16)
--------------------------

- Bug fixes:
        * Rows and columns of FrameDataEntities were switched
        * Compatibility with Matlab 2009: Better handling of 64-Bit numbers

--------------------------
Version 1.0.1 (2016-03-14)
--------------------------

- Bug fix: Ignore empty streams

--------------------------
Version 1.0.0 (2016-01-15)
--------------------------

- New installation package for Matlab 2015b and newer
- Use "surf" instead of "surfl" for McsSegmentStream.plot
- Bug fix:
	* Fixed bugs in the readPartial* functions where the conversion factor was not applied properly
	
--------------------------
Version 0.3.1 (2015-09-21)
--------------------------

- Bug fixes:
	* Fixed reading of files with multiple recordings
	* Renamed 'FrameDataEntities' to 'FrameDataEntity' in McsFrameStream.plot

--------------------------
Version 0.3.0 (2015-04-23)
--------------------------

- New features:
	* Segment stream subtype Average is treated independently from subtype Spike.
		Depending on the DataSubType of a McsSegmentStream, averages are handled by
		the McsAverageSegment class and (spike) cutouts by the McsCutoutSegment class,
		both having their own plot function.
	* Added option 'window' to readPartialEventData and readPartialTimeStampData to 
		read in events and time stamps from a particular time range
	* Accept McsHdf5ProtocolVersion 3

- Bug fixes:
	* Fixed option 'event' in readPartialEventData to work as a vector of event indices
	* Fixed option 'timestamp' in readPartialTimeStampData to work as a vector of time stamp indices

--------------------------
Version 0.2.1 (2015-02-16)
--------------------------

- Bug fix:
	* Version check for McsHdf5ProtocolVersion 2

--------------------------
Version 0.2.0 (2014-12-18)
--------------------------

- New features:
	* Loading of partial data for all stream types: 
			readPartialChannelData
			readPartialFrameData
			readPartialEventData
			readPartialSegmentData
			readPartialTimeStampData
	* Custom 'disp' function for all streams. 
			With this, just displaying the stream information (e.g. data.Recording{1}.Analogstream{1}) will not trigger reading 
			the data from the file.

- Bug fixes:
	* Corrected the dimensions of the McsSegmentStream SegmentData. 
	  For consistency, this has to be (samples x segments) or 
	  (samples x segments x multisegments).
	* Corrected the dimension of the McsSegmentStream SegmentDataTimeStamps. 
	  This is now a (1 x samples) instead of a (samples x 1) vector
	* Corrected several errors in the documentation and the comments
			
- Code refactoring for consistency:
	* Renamed field 'FrameDataEntities' to 'FrameDataEntity' in McsFrameStream
	* Renamed function 'readPartialFrame' to 'readPartialFrameData' in McsFrameDataEntity
	* Renamed parameter 'channels' to 'channel' in McsAnalogStream.plot function
	* Renamed parameter 'segments' to 'segment' in McsSegmentStream.plot function
