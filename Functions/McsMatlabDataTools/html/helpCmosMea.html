%% Plotting
% Simple plot functions exist for the streams in the Acquisition data
% source:
%
%   plot(data.Recording{1}.Acquisition.ChannelStream{1},[])
%   plot(data.Recording{1}.Acquisition.EventStream{1},[])

% plot(data,[])

%%
% If the second parameter of the plot function is empty, the default
% parameters are used for plotting. Otherwise, one can specify
% configuration structures for more fine-grained plotting. For example, the
% following commands will plot channels 1 and 2 of the second analog
% stream:

%%
% Each plot function has its own set of options, so you need to check the
% individual help functions for the specifics:
%
%   help McsHDF5.McsEventStream.plot

%%
% You can specify these configuration options also in higher level plot
% functions to achieve the same thing:
%
%   cfg = [];
%   cfg.acq.analog{2}.channel = [1 2];
%   plot(data.Recording{1},cfg);
%
%   cfg = [];
%   cfg.conf.acq.analog{2}.channel = [1 2];
%   plot(data,cfg);

%%
% You can also specify additional options in the plot function. These are
% forwarded to the underlying MATLAB plotting functions. The following
% command produces a time series plot of the first analog stream with thick
% dashed red lines:
%
%   plot(data.Recording{1}.Acquisition.ChannelStream{1},cfg,'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHr','LineWidth',5);

%% Interactive Plots
% Plot functions for the STAExplorer data source and the SpikeSorter 
% data source produce interactive figures, i.e.
%
%   plot(data.Recording{1}.STAExplorer,[])
%   plot(data.Recording{1}.SpikeSorter,[])

%%
% The *STAExplorer* data source plot produces a Heat Map that visualizes
